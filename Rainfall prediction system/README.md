# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a predictive model for fine concentration rainfall forecasting using historical rainfall data. The model provides monthly insights for individual districts, supporting more accurate agricultural planning and disaster preparedness.

##  Project Overview

The system is designed to process and analyze rainfall data from 93 districts across multiple months, applying supervised machine learning algorithms to forecast monthly rainfall patterns. The project leverages open-source meteorological data sourced from Kaggle.

### Objectives:
- Analyze rainfall patterns at a district level using historical data.
- Predict monthly rainfall to support regional planning and decision-making.
- Evaluate and compare multiple machine learning models for best performance.

##  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB)  
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Rainfall in India Dataset]

##  Model Development

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, filtered irrelevant columns, and normalized rainfall values.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted district, month, and historical trends as model inputs.  
- **Model Training**: Trained LR, KNN, and NB models on labeled data split by district and time.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Used accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation to assess model performance.

##  Outcomes

- Developed a machine learning-based rainfall prediction system with reliable monthly insights at the district level.  
- Improved forecasting capabilities for fine rainfall concentration using multiple classifiers.  
- Enabled data-driven decision-making for agricultural and environmental planning.
